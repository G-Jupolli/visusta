Here I am trying to recreate this video's processing steps:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gg40RWiaHRY

I'm planning on having a different use case.
The video is a process of making a game shader than can display as ASCII art.
The main use I want for this is to generate the actual text strings to be
  displayed on a site.
I'll have to do some post mortem on if this was worth it.

The video is considering a text size to transform the image into.
I may take the same 8x8 font size and use a mono font for display.

Filters I can make for the process:
 - Down scaler
 - De-saturation (greyscale)
    - Into Discrete
    - Into Chars
 - Edge Detection Options:
    1. Sobel Filter ( What the video is using, don't have distance data in static image)
    2. Canny Edge Detector
    3. Difference Of Gaussians
    - Video recommends Sobel as it has direction data of gradient


Additional Filters:
 - Dither
